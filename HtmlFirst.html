                <h1 class="main-content-headers">Early Childhood</h1>
                    <p class="main-content-text">I was born in a country called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" target="_blank">El Salvador</a></b> located in the central America, and to be honest since I moved when I was 6 
                    to the <b>U.S</b> I don't really remember much from the 6 years I was there aside from the taste of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupusa" target="_blank">Pupusa's</a>. But I do remember having the luxury
                    to go to a private german School in El Salvador called:<a href="http://www.walte.edu.sv/index.php?lang=es" target="_blank">WALTE</a> which I eventually left, because while attending there
                    I ended up cutting off a piece of my ear, requiring me to get plastic surgery and having a surgeon sew it back together.(*--In a country like El Salvador they sometimes play by the different rule, compared to the US. Whereas in the Us , they would have a large lawsuit in El Salvador all they had to do  is kick you out and threaten you , if you go to the courts--*). </p>

				   <h2 class="main-content-headers">Moving to America</h2>
                    <p class="main-content-text">I have been to certain American cities for short instances when I was 6 when like the time I flew with my mom to San Francisco. I remember vividly the first time 
                    I saw snow there. I freaked out, <i>seeing</i> the shower of these crystals that would disintegrate if your try to hold them.(*--since being a kid from a place where its normal for the temperature to be 100&#8457; and the idea of snow just reminded me of Christmas to much--*) But, aside from
                    that America was and all that came with it was something completely new to me.(*--That included English, since at the time I only spoke Spanish--*)</p>
